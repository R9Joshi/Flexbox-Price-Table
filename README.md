# Flexbox-Price-Table
A responsive pricing table built using CSS Flexbox. This project is part of my journey through "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. The table showcases pricing cards that adjust their layout based on screen size, demonstrating the power of Flexbox for modern, responsive design.
## Features:
- Responsive pricing table design
- Flexible and scalable layout using Flexbox
